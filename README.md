The IBA Cocktail app is a list of all cocktails that are approved by the International Bartender Association. You can use this app to find and save cocktails that fit your taste.

## Functions

Through this app, users will be able to set up a log in account and do the following:

- Browse coctails by name or spirit
- Create a "Favorite 5" list
- Recieve reccomendations based on ingredients found in cocktails
- Let the app select a random drink for you to try

Please note this only contains cocktails sanctioned by the I.B.A. We know there are thousands of tasty libations out there, however we have kept it to the essentials.
